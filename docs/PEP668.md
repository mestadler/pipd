# PIPD and PEP 668: Working with Externally Managed Environments

## Understanding PEP 668

PEP 668 introduces the concept of "Externally Managed Environments" to prevent pip from modifying system-managed Python installations. This is implemented in recent Debian/Ubuntu versions to prevent conflicts between pip and apt packages.

### The Problem

When you try to use pip on modern Debian/Ubuntu systems:

```bash
$ pip install requests
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
```

### How PIPD Solves This

PIPD works around PEP 668 by:

1. **Never using pip on the system Python**
2. **Creating isolated virtual environments for package operations**
3. **Converting packages to .deb format for system installation**
4. **Maintaining separation between Python and system package managers**

## Technical Implementation

### Virtual Environment Workflow

When you run `pipd install requests`, here's what happens:

```python
# 1. Create temporary virtual environment
temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix='pipd_')
venv_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'venv')
subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'venv', venv_dir])

# 2. Install package in the venv
venv_pip = os.path.join(venv_dir, 'bin', 'pip')
subprocess.run([venv_pip, 'install', 'requests'])

# 3. Convert to .deb package
# ... conversion logic ...

# 4. Install .deb system-wide
subprocess.run(['dpkg', '-i', 'python3-requests.deb'])
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **No PEP 668 Conflicts**: Virtual environments are not externally managed
2. **Clean System**: Packages installed via dpkg are tracked by apt
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Both apt and pip dependencies are respected
4. **Rollback Support**: Failed installations can be cleanly rolled back

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Installing a Pure Python Package

```bash
# This would fail with PEP 668:
# $ pip install requests

# With pipd:
$ sudo pipd install requests
[INFO] Resolving package: requests
[INFO] Package found on PyPI
[INFO] Creating virtual environment at /tmp/pipd_abc123/venv
[INFO] Installing requests in virtual environment
[INFO] Converting to debian package
[INFO] Installing python3-requests from converted package
[INFO] Installation completed successfully
```

### Example 2: Handling Dependencies

```bash
$ sudo pipd install flask
[INFO] Resolving package: flask
[INFO] Package found on PyPI
[INFO] Creating virtual environment at /tmp/pipd_def456/venv
[INFO] Installing flask in virtual environment
[INFO] Dependencies detected: werkzeug, jinja2, click, itsdangerous
[INFO] Converting packages to debian format
[INFO] Installing converted packages
[INFO] Installation completed successfully
```

### Example 3: When System Package Exists

```bash
$ sudo pipd install numpy
[INFO] Resolving package: numpy
[INFO] Package found in Debian repositories: python3-numpy
[INFO] Installing python3-numpy from Debian repositories
[INFO] Installation completed successfully
```

## Configuration for PEP 668

You can configure pipd's behavior regarding virtual environments:

```toml
# /etc/pipd/config.toml

[venv]
# Always use fresh virtual environments
reuse_venv = false

# Virtual environment creation timeout
venv_timeout = 300

# Extra packages to install in every venv
extra_packages = ["wheel", "setuptools"]

[conversion]
# Prefer stdeb over py2deb for conversion
prefer_stdeb = false

# Fallback methods if primary conversion fails
enable_fallbacks = true
```

## Comparison with Other Approaches

### Using pip with --break-system-packages

```bash
# NOT RECOMMENDED - can break system
pip install --break-system-packages requests
```

**Problems**:
- Can conflict with system packages
- No rollback mechanism
- Difficult to track what's installed

### Using pipx

```bash
# Good for applications, not libraries
pipx install httpie
```

**Limitations**:
- Only for command-line applications
- Not for Python libraries
- Each app in its own environment

### Using virtual environments manually

```bash
# Traditional approach
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install requests
```

**Limitations**:
- Requires activation
- Not system-wide
- Manual management

### Using PIPD

```bash
# Best of all worlds
sudo pipd install requests
```

**Advantages**:
- System-wide installation
- Debian package integration
- Automatic virtual environment handling
- Transaction support with rollback

## FAQ

### Q: Why not just use apt for everything?

A: Not all Python packages are available in Debian repositories, and those that are might be outdated.

### Q: Is this compatible with system Python packages?

A: Yes! PIPD checks for Debian packages first and only falls back to PyPI if needed.

### Q: What about virtual environments for development?

A: PIPD is for system-wide packages. For development, continue using regular virtual environments.

### Q: Can I still use pip in virtual environments?

A: Absolutely! PEP 668 only affects system Python. Virtual environments work normally.

### Q: What if package conversion fails?

A: PIPD has multiple fallback methods:
1. Try py2deb
2. Try stdeb
3. Try wheel conversion
4. Create minimal .deb package

## Best Practices

1. **Always use PIPD for system packages**: `sudo pipd install package`
2. **Use virtual environments for development**: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. **Check Debian packages first**: `apt search python3-package`
4. **Keep system clean**: Use `pipd list` to track Python packages

## Conclusion

PIPD elegantly solves the PEP 668 challenge by:
- Respecting the system/Python boundary
- Providing a familiar interface
- Ensuring system integrity
- Offering rollback protection

This makes it the ideal tool for managing Python packages on modern Debian/Ubuntu systems where PEP 668 is enforced.
